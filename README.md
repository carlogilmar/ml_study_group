**💡 Insights:**
- **Machine Learning** refers to the computer's ability to learn without being programmed.
- There are types of ML: **supervised and unsupervised learning, recommender systems, and reinforcement learning.**
- **Supervised Learning** are algorithms that learning from X inputs to generate Y outputs.
  - There are two types of Supervised Learning algorithms: **regression and classification.**
  - **Regression** algorithms are for predict a number, there are infinite possible outputs.
  - **Classification** algorithms are for predicts categories.
- **Unsupervised Learning** works with data that is not associated to an specific output.
  - This algorithms try to **find structure** in the data.
  - **Clustering** is one kind of this algortihms.
