Insights:
1. **Machine Learning** refers to the computer's ability to learn without being programmed.
2. There are types of ML: **supervised and unsupervised learning, recommender systems, and reinforcement learning.**
3. **Supervised Learning** are algorithms that learning from X inputs to generate Y outputs.
4. There are two types of Supervised Learning algorithms: **regression and classification.**
5. **Regression** algorithms are for predict a number, there are infinite possible outputs.
6. **Classification** algorithms are for predicts categories.
